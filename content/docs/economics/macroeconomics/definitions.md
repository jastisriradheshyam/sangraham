# Aggregate output

- The national income and product accounts were developed at the end of WWII to measure aggregate output
- The main measure of aggregate output is "Gross Domestic Product" or GDP


## GDP

| Steel Company (Firm 1)     | Car Company (Firm 2)     |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------|
| Revenue from sales: $100   | Revenue from sales: $200 |
| Expenses          : $80    | Expenses          : $170 |
|   Wages:  $80              |   Wages          :  $70  |
|                            |   Steel purchases:  $100 |
| Profit            : $20    | Profit            :  $30 |

- GDP is the value of final goods & services produces in the economy during a given period
- GDP is the sum of value added in the economy during a given period.
    - Value added from Steel: $100; Value added from Car: $200-$100=$100; Sum of Value added = $200
- GDP is the sum of incomes in the economy during a given period.
    - Wages = $80 + $70 = $150; Profit = $20 + $30 = $50; Sum of incomes = $200

## Nominal vs Real GDP

- Nominal GDP is the sum of quantities of final goods produced times their current price
    - The production of most goods increases over time
    - THe price of most goods increases over time
- We want to isolate the first reason to measure how aggregate output grows over time
- Read GDP (or just GDP) is the sum of quantities of final goods times constant (not current) prices
    - Or when we remove inflation component from Nominal GDP we get Real GDP
- We denote nominal GDP by "$Y<sub>t</sub>" and real GDP by "Y<sub>t</sub>"
- There are two reasons nominal GDP is growing
    1. Economy is being productive by producing more goods
    2. Prices are going up due to inflation


# Goods and Services

- Goods: Goods are things that are tangible
- Services: Services is not tangible, they're benefits that you receive from the tasks that someone else operates on or for you.
