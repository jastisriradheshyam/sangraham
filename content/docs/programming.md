# Structural patterns

- Repository Pattern

# Clean architecture

- Seperation of concerns
    - Each level in your program should be seperated by a clear barrier, the transport layer, the service layer, the storage layer, etc.

- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
    - You're injecting the dependencies in your layers. You dont directly call them.
    - Why? It promotes loose coupling and makes it easier to test our programs.

- Adaptability to change
    - By organizing the code in a modular and flexible way, we can more easily introduce new features, refactor existing code, and respond to evolving business requirements.
    - Systems should be easy to change, if we have to change a lot of existing code to add a new feature then we are doing it wrong.

- Focus on business value
    - Focus on delivering value to your users, they are the ones who will be paying bills at the end of the month.


# Programming languages features

## Reflection

"Reflection in computing is the ability of a program to examine its own structure, particularly through types; itâ€™s a form of metaprogramming."[1]

Languages support reflection (not a exaustive list)

1. Go [^1]
2. Java
3. Javascript [^2][^3]
4. Python
5. .Net
