# Programming languages features

## Structured Language

A programming language can be called as structured language if there is compartmentalization of code and data.[^4]

Example: `C`

## Block structured language

Block structured language permit procedures or functions to be declared inside other functions or procedures.[^4]

Example: `ALGOL`, `Pascal`, `Javascript` and `Swift`

## Reflection

"Reflection in computing is the ability of a program to examine its own structure, particularly through types; itâ€™s a form of metaprogramming."[1]

Languages support reflection (not a exhaustive list)

1. Go [^1]
2. Java
3. Javascript [^2][^3]
4. Python
5. .Net

# Programming conceptual memory mapping [^4]

- Program code (object code in case of compiled)
- Global variables
- Stack
    - It holds return addresses of function calls, arguments to functions, local variables, also current state of CPU, etc.
- Heap
    - region where dynamic allocation is preformed at run time.
