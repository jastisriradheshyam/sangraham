Software Engineering is the application of scientific principles to the design and creation of software
The field uses a systematic approach to collect and analyse business requirements in order to design, build, and test software applications to satisfy those business requirements

## CASE (Computer-aided software engineering)

CASE six categories:
1. Business Analysis & modeling
2. Debugging environments
3. Verification & Validation tools
4. Configuration management
5. Metrics & measurement
6. Project management

## Software Engineer vs Software Developer

Software Engineer | Software Developer
|:---------------:|:-----------------:|
Also developers | |
A software engnieer's knowledge is usually broader | |
Take a systematic, big picture approach in their thinking to software development | Developer may have more creative approaches |
Use specialized knowledge to build entire systems | software developers use their knowledge to write code to implement specific functionality within a system |
Often employed on larger scale projects and they are focused on the broad structure rather then solving an immediate problem | |

## Software engineer responsibilites
1. Tasked with designing, building, and maintaining software systems
2. Write and test code
3. Consult with stakeholders, third party vendors, security specialists, and other team members
