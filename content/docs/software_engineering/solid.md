**SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open Close Principle, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion)**

# Single Responsibility

A class should only have one reason to change. This minimizes the impact of modifications.

## Advantages

- Easier to understand and maintain 
- Writing unit test cases for the class becomes easier
- it provides flexibility as change in one responsibility / class don't affect unrelated parts of the system

# Openâ€“closed principle

An class / any software entity should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Advantages

- It maintains code stability and reduce bugs

# Liskov substitution principle

function / functions that use pointers or references to base class must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it. in terms of class, objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of subclasses without affecting the program's correctness.

# Interface segregation principle

Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces they do not use.

## Advantages

- Encourages creating multiple, specific interfaces rather than a single, general purpose interface
- It prevents a class from being forced to implement interface it doesn't use. Reducing the side effects of changes in unrelated interfaces. 

# Dependency inversion principle

High level modules shouldn't depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
